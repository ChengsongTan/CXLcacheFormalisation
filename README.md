# Artifact Appendix

## A.1 Abstract
This artifact consists of the formal model of the cache coherence protocol of Compute Express Link (CXL)‚ÄìCXL.cache. It contains the model and proof of the Single-Writer-Multiple-Reader (SWMR) property of CXL.cache in the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant, as described in the paper ‚ÄúFormalising CXL Cache Coherence‚Äù. The protocol is modelled as a transition system over system state, where a system state comprises cacheline states, communication channels, buffers and other auxiliary structures.

## A.3 Description
The file that contains the definitions of the system state with type-1 devices (corresponding to the datatype definition in Figure 3 in section 3) is `Transposed.thy` (see line 157 the record definition `Type1State`). Together with the record type, some functions for manipulating certain fields of `Type1State` are also defined. The transition rules as shown in Figure 4 in section 3 of the system are defined in the file `BuggyRules.thy`.

The coherence property that is shown to be an inductive invariant of the system lies in `CoherenceProperties.thy` (see line 199, definition `SWMR_state_machine`).

The `BasicInvariants.thy` file contains some basic invariants related to certain transitions and functions we already defined in `BuggyRules.thy` and `Transposed.thy`.

The proofs are in the rest of the `.thy` files in this artifact. Each transition rule is proven to maintain the inductive property (`SWMR_state_machine`). Since `SWMR_state_machine` is quite large (consisting of around 800 conjuncts), the proof of just a single rule is lengthy, each spanning more than 1,000 lines. They are therefore each stored in a dedicated file, where the filename corresponds to the name of the rule (up to a prefix).

As an example, the `FixSIAGO_WritePull.thy` file contains the proof that the `SIAGO_WritePull` rule maintains the `SWMR_state_machine` property. The main lemma stating this fact is at the end of the file (line 2915 with name `SIAGO_WritePull_coherent`).

The most important auxiliary lemma leading to this is `SIAGO_WritePull‚Äô_coherent_aux_simpler` (line 233). This auxiliary lemma breaks down the proof into hundreds of subgoals. We call lemmas like this ‚Äúrule lemmas‚Äù as they each correspond to a rule.

The top-level theorem stating the Single-Writer-Multiple-Reader property of the transition system is the corollary `SWMR_pplus_cache` in `TopLevelTheorem.thy` (line 354), corresponding to Theorem 6.2 in the paper. Some main theorems lead to this corollary:
- If `initial_state(ùëá)` then `SWMR_state_machine(ùëá)` (Theorem `SWMR_state_machine_CXL_cache` at line 321).  
- If `ùëá ‚àí‚Üí ùëá‚Äô` and `SWMR_state_machine(ùëá)` then `SWMR_state_machine(ùëá‚Äô)` (Theorem `all_transitions_coherent` at line 103).  

These two theorems correspond to the first two of the three properties described in the paper just before Theorem 6.

## Running Experiment

### Preparing suitable running environment
#### For Windows:
Download Isabelle2023 (see above URL). Double-click the downloaded installer to complete the installation process; it is suggested to put Isabelle2023 in some easy-to-access folder such as the desktop so it is easy to navigate there (needed later).

Clone or download the artifact from GitHub (see above URL). If you downloaded a zip of the artifact, uncompress this zip file.

#### For Linux: 
Download using this address:
```
https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2023/dist/Isabelle2023_linux.tar.gz
```

Then run the command from the command line in the folder where the downloaded file is stored:
```
tar -xzf Isabelle2023_linux.tar.gz
```


To be able to execute the `isabelle` command in the artifact folder, run these commands to add the path to your Isabelle bin directory to your PATH variable:
```
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/home/ubuntu/Downloads/Isabelle2023/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
```


To make this immediately effective, run:
```
source ~/.bashrc
```


Now try running `isabelle` in the command line, and you should get output like:
```
Usage: isabelle TOOL [ARGS ...]
```

### Download artifact
Download our formalization from the GitHub repository (uncompress if you downloaded the zip file):
```
https://github.com/ChengsongTan/CXLcacheFormalisation
```


In the following, `artifact_directory` refers to the artifact‚Äôs top-level path. To check that `artifact_directory` is the required folder, confirm that it contains many Isabelle theory files, such as `BasicInvariants.thy`, as well as a file called `ROOT`.

### Prepare the necessary settings
Run the command:
```
isabelle getenv ISABELLE_HOME_USER
```
This will output the path of a directory, e.g.,  
```
/home/ubuntu/.isabelle/Isabelle2023
```




### Run the workflow: preparation
Navigate to this directory, and open (create one if it does not yet exist) the file named `ROOTS` in an editor. Append a line containing the `artifact_directory` path. 
**`artifact_directory`** refers to the artifact‚Äôs top-level path. They are in different formats for different operating systems.

#### For Linux/MacO
In normal Unix-style formats. e.g. `/Users/Joe/CXLcacheFormalisation-main`

#### For Windows
In Cygwin path format. In this format:  
- A Windows path such as:  
```
C:\Users\Joe\CXLcacheFormalisation-main
```

is expressed as:  
```
/cygdrive/c/Users/Joe/CXLcacheFormalisation-main
```
(i.e., replace `C:\` with `/cygdrive/c/` and use forward slashes for the rest).



Save and close the `ROOTS` file.  

### Execute command running artifact
In a terminal, change into `artifact_directory` using the `cd` command. Then execute:
```
isabelle jedit -l AllFixes
```

Once you have entered this command, the Isabelle IDE will open, with messages starting:
```
Build started for Isabelle/AllFixes ...
Building AllFixes ...
AllFixes: theory AllFixes.Transposed
```

The process can be left running in the background. Taking roughly 3 hours, it should complete with an Isabelle session called `AllFixes`. The `AllFixes` session contains necessary context for the top-level theorem (e.g., all the rule lemmas).

## Expected results
After the last step above, open the `TopLevelTheorem.thy` file using the prover IDE (click on the IDE top-left corner ‚ÄúFile ‚Üí Open‚Äù). Scroll to the bottom to see the main theorems and corollaries (also presented in the paper).

You should find that every theorem has gone through without error, and that no occurrences of the `sorry` keyword exist in the file. This indicates the proof has been successfully mechanically checked.

In particular, see:
- `all_transitions_coherent` (line 103),  
- `SWMR_state_machine_CXL_cache` (line 321),  
- `SWMR_CXL_cache` (line 336),  
- `SWMR_pplus_cache` (line 354).
